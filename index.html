                    <p>I value teamwork and communication, so I would love to work in a job setting where everyone works together well and holds themselves accountable. I always make sure to finish my assignments on time, and I would love to depend on my coworkers to do the same. I have always been a positive person, which translates to my work as well. Even when working on a challenging project, I find it essential to stay positive about it. I believe this could influence my coworkers to act similarly.</p>
